# brianmccrory.github.io

Currently have two repos publishing to this destination:
1. Jekyll site for data checked into this repo directory. Github pages auto publishes when commits are pushed to the main branch.
2. Jekyll site "just-the-docs" published on demand using custom pages.yml workflow from separate repo (brianmcc) similar to how brianmcc-site repo was publising to separate domain previously.
