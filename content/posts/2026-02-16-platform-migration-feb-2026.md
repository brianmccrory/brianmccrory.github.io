### Jazz of Japan is now on a new platform.

If you were a current subscriber (as of Feb 16, 2026), you don’t need to do a thing.

What’s new?

- The entire archive is on www.jazzofjapan.com
- Only the underlying platform has changed
- The archive is no longer on jazzofjapan.substack.com

If you’d like to subscribe, unsubscribe or confirm your subscription to the new newsletter system, go to https://www.jazzofjapan.com.

Since Jazz of Japan is now independent of Substack, you can manage your subscription to this newsletter at https://www.jazzofjapan.com.

Separately, you can manage your Substack account at https://substack.com/settings for general Substack account settings and other newsletters.

Also, if you are subscribed but haven’t received the newsletter in several weeks, please check the Spam folder. Emails sent to Jazz of Japan newsletter subscribers will now come from the domain `jazzofjapan.com`. There may be a period of dust settling that accompanies this sort of platform change, but it shouldn’t be too bad. All archives and subscriptions have been transferred and everything should work the same. Oh, and if this email lands in your Spam folder for some reason, please mark it as “Not Spam” and move it to your Inbox. This should help to properly deliver future emails from this newsletter.

To reach out with any questions, concerns, or comments:

- Reply to any newsletter email
- Send a Substack message to [@brianmccrory](https://substack.com/@brianmccrory)

As always, thank you for your interest and support!
