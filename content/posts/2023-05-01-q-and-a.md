***What’s this site about?***

For sharing information about jazz and related music from Japan and Japanese musicians, mostly through albums released during the last twenty years. I write about both new releases and older albums in no particular order, but I try to prioritize new releases when I can.

***How can I find a specific musician here?***

Search the archive, or check the [Index](https://docs.jazzofjapan.com/), which has links to musicians’ websites and albums.

***How can I find albums with vocals, solo piano, violin, bossa nova, subgenres…***

Search the archive for keywords like “[straight ahead](https://www.jazzofjapan.com/archive/?q="straight%20ahead")”, “[bebop](https://www.jazzofjapan.com/archive/?q=bebop)”, “[solo piano](https://www.jazzofjapan.com/archive/?q="solo%20piano")”, “[violin](https://www.jazzofjapan.com/archive/?q=violin)”,  “[vocals](https://www.jazzofjapan.com/archive/?q=vocals)”, “[bossa nova](https://www.jazzofjapan.com/archive/?q="bossa%20nova")”, “[Brazilian](https://www.jazzofjapan.com/archive/?q=Brazilian)”, etc.

***Where can I buy these CDs?***

Check [hmv.co.jp](https://www.hmv.co.jp/), [amazon.co.jp](https://www.amazon.co.jp/), [tower.jp](https://tower.jp/), and [cdjapan.co.jp](https://www.cdjapan.co.jp/) (not all sites ship overseas). You may also be able to buy CDs directly from the musicians at their live shows or through their websites.

***What’s J Jazz?***

Japanese Jazz (see [What’s J Jazz?](https://www.jazzofjapan.com/archive/whats-j-jazz) for more). An early version of this website and newsletter was named *J Jazz*.

***Where are the albums by &#x2026;?***

There are some famous musicians and albums that are still missing from the archive. I hope to cover these excellent players and albums someday! Still, I do try to share information about newer albums and musicians that are not as widely discussed.

For example, some famous Japanese jazz musicians and groups include:

-   On piano: Toshiko Akiyoshi, Hiromi Uehara, Makoto Ozone, Ryo Fukui, Masabumi Kikuchi, Yosuke Yamashita, Masahiko Satoh, &#x2026;
-   On bass: Kiyoshi Kitagawa, Yasushi Nakamura, Noriko Ueda, Isao Suzuki, Tetsuo Sakurai, &#x2026;
-   On sax: Sadao Watanabe, Kosuke Mine, Hideaki Mochizuki, &#x2026;
-   On trumpet: Terumasa Hino, Takuya Kuroda, Fumio Nanri, Hideo Shiraki, &#x2026;
-   On drums: George Kawaguchi, Takeshi Inomata, Akira Jimbo , Fukushi Tainaka, &#x2026;
-   On guitar: Ryo Kawasaki, Kazumi Watanabe, Issei Noro, &#x2026;
-   Groups: T-Square, Soil & “Pimp” Sessions, Kyoto Jazz Massive, Casiopea, Orange Pekoe, Tokyo Jihen, KBB, Quasimode, &#x2026;

***How are the names of Japanese musicians displayed here?***

The musicians’ names on this website are shown in *first-name last-name* order when written in English (given name first), and *last-name first-name* order in Japanese (family name first). For example:

-   Akane Matsumoto is 松本茜, where Akane is 茜 and Matsumoto is 松本, typically read in Japanese in the order 松本 (*MATSUMOTO*) 茜 (*AKANE*).
-   Fumio Karashima is 辛島文雄, where Fumio is 文雄 and Karashima is 辛島, typically read in Japanese in the order 辛島 (*KARASHIMA*) 文雄 (*FUMIO*).

Although some official organizations and media use the traditional Japanese name order as standard, in many cases (such as on albums and music catalogs) Japanese musicians’ names are shown in *first-name last-name* order when displayed in English, such as with an artist or a band name.
